# Impulse Excitation Testing

A non-destructive method for measuring elastic properties of materials through vibration analysis.

## What is Impulse Excitation?

Impulse excitation testing determines Young's modulus, shear modulus, and Poisson's ratio by analyzing the natural frequencies of vibrating test specimens. When a material is struck with a small impulse, it vibrates at frequencies directly related to its elastic properties.

## Quick Start

1. **Prepare sample** - Rectangular bar (3-5× width, 2-4× thickness)
2. **Set up supports** - Position at 0.224L from each end
3. **Apply impulse** - Strike near center, record vibration
4. **Analyze frequency** - Identify natural frequencies
5. **Calculate properties** - Use standard formulas

## Key Advantages

- **Non-destructive** - Preserves test specimens
- **Fast** - Results in minutes
- **Accurate** - ±0.1-0.5% precision typical
- **Versatile** - Works with metals, ceramics, composites

## When to Use

- Material characterization and quality control
- Process monitoring and optimization
- Research and development
- Non-destructive evaluation
