# Applications

Impulse excitation testing finds applications across diverse industries for material characterization, quality control, and process optimization.

## Key Applications

### [Grinding Wheels](/docs/applications/grinding-wheels/)
The foundational application that launched GrindoSonic. Grinding wheels made it clear why impulse excitation works—it reveals internal integrity with a single tap, measuring exact stiffness through resonance, mass, and dimensions.

### [Non-Destructive Testing in Additive Manufacturing](/docs/applications/ndt-additive-manufacturing/)
Essential for ensuring reliability and safety of 3D-printed components. NDT in AM enables rapid feedback, continuous process improvement, and risk reduction in critical applications.
