# Measurement Procedure

## Pre-Measurement Checklist

- [ ] Sample dimensions measured accurately
- [ ] Sample mass determined
- [ ] Supports positioned correctly (0.224L)
- [ ] Sensor functioning properly
- [ ] Software configured
- [ ] Environmental conditions stable

## Step-by-Step Process

### 1. Sample Preparation
- Measure dimensions (L, W, T) to ±0.01mm
- Weigh sample to ±0.1mg
- Check surface finish (Ra < 1.6 μm)
- Verify sample condition (no cracks, defects)

### 2. Sample Placement
- Position on supports at 0.224L from ends
- Ensure stable contact
- Check for rocking or movement
- Verify level positioning

### 3. Sensor Positioning
- Mount accelerometer near center
- Ensure secure attachment
- Check electrical connections
- Verify signal level

### 4. Excitation
- Apply impulse near center
- Use consistent force
- Strike perpendicular to surface
- Allow free vibration

### 5. Data Acquisition
- Start recording before excitation
- Record for 1-2 seconds
- Monitor signal quality
- Stop recording when complete

### 6. Signal Processing
- Apply window function (Hanning)
- Perform FFT analysis
- Identify natural frequencies
- Measure peak frequencies

### 7. Property Calculation
- Calculate Young's modulus from flexural frequency
- Calculate shear modulus from torsional frequency
- Calculate Poisson's ratio from E and G
- Verify results are reasonable

## Quality Control

### Multiple Measurements
- Perform 3-5 measurements
- Calculate mean and standard deviation
- Check for outliers
- Verify consistency

### Validation
- Compare with literature values
- Test with reference materials
- Check temperature effects
- Verify material behavior

## Data Recording

### Required Information
- Sample identification
- Dimensions and mass
- Environmental conditions
- Measurement parameters
- Calculated properties
- Uncertainty values

### File Organization
- Raw time domain signals
- Processed frequency spectra
- Calculated properties
- Measurement logs
- Calibration data

## Common Mistakes

- Incorrect support positioning
- Insufficient excitation force
- Poor sensor positioning
- Inadequate signal processing
- Ignoring environmental effects
