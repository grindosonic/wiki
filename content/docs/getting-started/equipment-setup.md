# Equipment Setup

## System Components

### Main Unit
- Impulse excitation measurement system
- Data acquisition hardware
- Analysis software
- Display and controls

### Support System
- Two support points (knife-edge or point supports)
- Adjustable positioning
- Low damping materials (steel, ceramic)
- Stable base

### Excitation
- Small hammer or striker
- Consistent force application
- Appropriate for specimen size
- Non-damaging

### Sensors
- Accelerometer (preferred) or microphone
- Adequate frequency response (0-10 kHz)
- Good sensitivity
- Secure mounting

## Setup Procedure

### 1. Position Supports
- Place supports at 0.224L from each end
- Ensure level and stable positioning
- Minimal contact area
- Low damping materials

### 2. Mount Sensor
- Position near center (anti-node)
- Secure attachment
- Minimal mass loading
- Good electrical contact

### 3. Configure Software
- Set sampling rate (10-50 kHz)
- Configure FFT parameters
- Set frequency range (0-10 kHz)
- Enable peak detection

### 4. Test System
- Verify sensor response
- Check signal quality
- Test excitation consistency
- Validate software operation

## Environmental Requirements

### Temperature
- Stable temperature (±1°C)
- Room temperature typical
- Avoid drafts and heating/cooling

### Vibration Isolation
- Stable surface
- Minimal external vibrations
- Vibration isolation table (optional)

### Acoustic Environment
- Quiet environment
- Minimal background noise
- Consistent conditions

## Calibration

### Reference Materials
- Use certified reference specimens
- Known elastic properties
- Regular calibration schedule
- Document calibration data

### System Verification
- Test with reference specimen
- Compare with certified values
- Verify measurement accuracy
- Document results

## Troubleshooting Setup

### Common Issues
- **Poor signal quality**: Check sensor positioning and connections
- **Inconsistent results**: Verify support positioning and excitation
- **No signal**: Check sensor operation and connections
- **Software errors**: Verify configuration and restart if needed

### Quality Checks
- Signal amplitude adequate
- Clear frequency peaks
- Consistent measurements
- Proper peak identification
