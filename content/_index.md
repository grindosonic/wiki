# Welcome to the Knowledge Base

This wiki is the central place for technical documentation about **Impulse Excitation** and related material testing methods.  

Here you’ll find:
- 📖 **Testing Methods** — how impulse excitation compares to traditional destructive tests.  
- 🔬 **Material Properties** — understanding vibrations, damping, and elastic moduli.  
- ⚙️ **Industrial Applications** — from brake pads to precision mechanics.  
- 🧱 **Material Classes** — concrete, metals, ceramics, and more.  
- 🚀 **Research & Development** — new insights and standards in non-destructive testing.
