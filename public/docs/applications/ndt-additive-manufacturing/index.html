</h2>
<p>In the world of additive manufacturing (AM), ensuring consistent part quality and machine reliability is key. At GrindoSonic, we believe non-destructive testing (NDT) should be embedded throughout the entire AM lifecycle—not just applied to finished parts, but also to the machines themselves.</p>

  Testing the Process, Not Just the Product
  
  <a class="anchor" href="#testing-the-process-not-just-the-product">#</a>
  
</h3>
<p>Before production begins, we print standardized test geometries—our own equivalent of the well-known &ldquo;Benchy&rdquo;—to evaluate machine behavior using resonance-based NDT. These quick checks help detect mechanical or thermal inconsistencies in the system, providing early warnings before real parts are produced.</p>
<h3 id="post-print-and-post-process-validation">
  Post-Print and Post-Process Validation
  
  <a class="anchor" href="#post-print-and-post-process-validation">#</a>
  
</h3>
<p>Once a component is printed, we apply our resonance inspection methods to assess internal integrity. The same part can then be re-checked after heat treatment or post-processing steps, allowing for direct comparison and insight into how each phase impacts material properties.</p>
<h3 id="one-workflow-one-quality-monitor">
  One Workflow, One Quality Monitor

<p>All measurements—whether from test prints or production parts—are logged into a centralized quality dashboard. This provides full traceability and a coherent quality overview, making it easier to spot trends, identify issues, and continuously improve print parameters and process settings.</p>
<p>By integrating NDT at every stage, GrindoSonic helps ensure not only that the final part meets expectations, but that the entire AM workflow is under control—machine to material, start to finish.</p>

</h2>
<p>The future of NDT in AM is driven by the fusion of artificial intelligence and smart automation. AI and machine learning algorithms are increasingly used to analyze massive volumes of inspection data, quickly flagging anomalies and predicting system failures before they occur. This leads to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Higher throughput and more reliable quality control</li>
<li>Reduced false positives and operator subjectivity</li>
<li>Predictive maintenance and continuous optimization of AM processes</li>
</ul>

</h2>
<p>As additive manufacturing (AM) matures, non-destructive testing (NDT) is becoming an essential part of ensuring part reliability and process consistency. But to make NDT truly valuable in a 3D printing environment, it&rsquo;s important to go beyond just ticking the box. Here are some practical ways to get the most out of it:</p>
<h3 id="use-tools-that-fit-naturally-into-the-am-workflow">
  Use tools that fit naturally into the AM workflow
  
  <a class="anchor" href="#use-tools-that-fit-naturally-into-the-am-workflow">#</a>
  
</h3>
<p>The most effective NDT methods are those that match the needs of 3D printing: quick, non-invasive, and easy to apply regularly. For many applications, resonance-based techniques provide just that—offering insight into material stiffness, structural consistency, and internal defects without requiring complicated setups or destructive samples.</p>
<h3 id="keep-it-simple-for-the-user">

  <a class="anchor" href="#keep-it-simple-for-the-user">#</a>
  
</h3>
<p>Complex inspection setups can slow everything down. Systems that are easy to use and interpret make it far more likely that testing will be done consistently—and correctly. Ideally, operators shouldn&rsquo;t need to be specialists to get meaningful data.</p>
<h3 id="digitize-inspection-data">
  Digitize inspection data
  
  <a class="anchor" href="#digitize-inspection-data">#</a>

<p>Logging results automatically and keeping a digital trail of all inspections helps build traceability and compliance into the process. It also enables long-term tracking of machine performance, material variation, and process stability.</p>
<h3 id="make-quality-a-continuous-concern">
  Make quality a continuous concern
  
  <a class="anchor" href="#make-quality-a-continuous-concern">#</a>
  
</h3>
<p>When inspection is fast and repeatable, it shifts from being an afterthought to becoming part of the daily workflow. This proactive approach helps catch issues earlier, improve print parameters, and boost confidence in the final product.</p>
<h3 id="leverage-automation-where-possible">
